   - Provide a detailed description of what your changes do, and any relevant context.

### Discuss Your Ideas Before Starting

Before working on large or complex features, please **open an issue** to discuss your idea. This helps ensure that everyone agrees on the approach, and prevents unnecessary work. It's a great way to get feedback early!

### Every Contribution Counts!

We appreciate contributions of all sizes, whether it's a small fix or a new feature. Even simple things like rewording documentation or fixing typos help improve the project.
