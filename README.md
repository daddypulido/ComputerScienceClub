I am creating a github repository where we can get real life experience in Git and Github and creating a project that we might be able to add to our resume if we complete it. This would be an open source project(here is a link if you are not sure what open source means https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software).



Please leave your suggestions in projects we can work in by going to issues tab. Click on issues and write your issue and create it.
